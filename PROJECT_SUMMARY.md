3. ✅ **Tasks Manager** (Priority-based with filtering)
4. ✅ **Today Setup** (Work schedule input with 2 modes)
5. ✅ **Generated Plan** (Timeline with drag/drop, lock, complete)
6. ✅ **History** (Daily logs, streaks, weekly overview)

#### 5. **Technical Requirements** ✅
- ✅ Clean architecture with scheduling engine module
- ✅ Unit tests for scheduler
- ✅ Deterministic scheduling
- ✅ Timezone support
- ✅ Robust text parsing
- ✅ Seed sample data and demo mode

#### 6. **Acceptance Criteria** ✅
- ✅ Given work 9:30-18:00 and dinner 19:00-20:00
- ✅ Schedules gym respecting rules
- ✅ Schedules 3+ daily habits in reasonable windows
- ✅ Schedules priority tasks until time exhausted
- ✅ Leaves buffers between blocks
- ✅ Re-optimize preserves locked gym
- ✅ Minimum gym or "missed" suggestions

## 🏗️ Architecture & Code Quality

### **Clean Architecture**
```
src/
├── types/           # Comprehensive TypeScript definitions
├── lib/             # Core business logic
│   ├── database.ts  # IndexedDB with Dexie
│   └── scheduling-engine.ts  # The "brain" algorithm
├── app/             # Next.js pages (6 screens)
├── utils/           # Time utilities and helpers
└── __tests__/       # Unit tests
```

### **Advanced Features Beyond Requirements**
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard** with streaks and insights
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI** with Tailwind CSS and responsive design
- 🔄 **Drag & Drop** timeline for manual adjustments
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive** design
- 💾 **Data Export/Import** for backup and migration
- 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing** with Jest
- 📖 **Detailed Documentation** with examples

### **Sophisticated Scheduling Algorithm**
The scheduling engine implements a multi-factor scoring system:

```typescript
// Scoring factors for optimal placement:
- Priority weight (1-5 scale)
- Urgency (due date proximity) 
- Time window preference matching
- Energy level alignment
- Fragmentation penalty (prefer longer slots)
- Late-night penalty (avoid bedtime scheduling)
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Navigate to project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/rahulsikinam/Desktop/daily-organization-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
